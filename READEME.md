In this lab, you create several VPC networks and VM instances and test connectivity across networks. Specifically, you create two custom mode networks (managementnet and privatenet) with firewall rules and VM instances, as shown in this network diagram:

The mynetwork network, its firewall rules, and two VM instances (mynet-notus-vm and mynet-us-vm) have already been created for you in this Qwiklabs project.

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create custom mode VPC networks with firewall rules
Create VM instances using Compute Engine
Explore the connectivity for VM instances across VPC networks
Create a VM instance with multiple network interfaces
